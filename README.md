Narratify is a desktop application that transforms your e-books (PDF and EPUB) into engaging audiobooks using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. It features a simple, retro-themed graphical interface built with PyQt6, allowing users to easily load documents, choose voices, adjust speed, and listen to or save the generated audio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x installed.
    *   Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed and accessible in your system's PATH (required by Apache Tika).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hawks-lab/hawkslab-narratify.git
    cd hawkslab-narratify
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Then install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: The first time Kokoro TTS runs, it might download necessary models.*

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    You should see the splash screen while dependencies load, followed by the main application window.

2.  **Load an E-book:**
    *   Click the "LOAD EBOOK" button (either top-right or center).
    *   Alternatively, use the menu: `File` > `Open eBook`.
    *   Select a supported file (`.pdf` or `.epub`).
    *   Wait for the parsing process to complete. The text content will appear in the left panel.

3.  **Configure Conversion:**
    *   In the right panel ("CONFIGURATION"), select your desired voice from the "VOICE SELECT" dropdown.
    *   Click "TEST" to hear a preview of the selected voice.
    *   Adjust the "PLAYBACK SPEED" slider (0.5x to 2.0x).

4.  **Convert to Audio:**
    *   Click the "CONVERT TO AUDIO" button.
    *   A progress window will appear, showing the conversion status. This may take several minutes depending on the length of the text and your system speed.

5.  **Playback and Save:**
    *   Once conversion is complete, the "AUDIO PLAYER" panel will become active.
    *   Use the `‚ñ∂` (Play/Pause), `‚óÄ‚óÄ` (Seek Back), and `‚ñ∂‚ñ∂` (Seek Forward) buttons.
    *   The slider shows playback progress.
    *   Click "SAVE" to save the generated audiobook as a `.wav` file.
    *   Click "NEW" to return to the configuration screen for a new conversion (keeps the current text loaded).

6.  **Other Features:**
    *   **Theme:** Use `View` > `Toggle Theme` (or `Ctrl+T`) to switch between dark and light modes.
    *   **About:** Find application info under `Help` > `About`.
    *   **Exit:** Close the application via the window controls or `File` > `Exit` (`Ctrl+Q`).
